    " In this assignment, you will do exercises on arcpy.Exists(), arcpy.Walk(), arcpy.da.Describe(), python list comprehension, arcpy.da.SearchCursor, and arcpy.da.InsertCursor(). In each section, a code block is provided but not ready to run. You need to add this notebook to ArcGIS Pro, modify each block to make it runable, keep the output message , and write an explanation of the code block. \n",

    "1. imports the `arcpy` module\n",
    "2. defines `fc` and assigns it to the feature class \"points\" in the current Map\n",
    "3. defines `newfieldName` and assigns it the name \"all\"\n",
    "4. calls `AddField_management()` from `arcpy` to add a new field in the feature class (`fc`), naming it (`newfieldName`), and assigning it the datatype \"DOUBLE\"\n",
    "5. defines `expression` as the string `sum(!Field1!,!Field2!,!Field3!)` which specifies how the new field will be calculated\n",
    "6. begins a code block athat defines the logic for the calculation\n",
    "7. defines a function named `sum` that can accept multiple fields as arguments (`*fields`)\n",
    "8. creates a variable `sum` and assigns it the initial value of `0` to store the cumulative total\n",
    "9. uses a `for` loop to iterate through each field passed to the `sum` function\n",
    "10. adds the value of each field to the running total (`sum`)\n",
    "11. returns the final computed sum after all the field values have been processed\n",
    "12. closes the code block with `\"\"\"`\n",
    "13. calls the `CalculateField_management` module from `arcpy` to fill in the rows of the newly created field (`newfieldName`) with the results of calculation defined by `expression` and `codeblock`\n",

    "- The Field Calculator interface has input fields for the Input Table (the dataset being modified), the Field Name (either an existing field or a new one to calculate values for), and Expression Type (the coding language to use, such as Python or Arcade). Below these, there are fields for the Expression (the formula or calculation) and an optional Code Block (for defining custom functions).\n",
