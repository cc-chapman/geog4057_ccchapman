    " In this assignment, you will do exercises on arcpy.Exists(), arcpy.Walk(), arcpy.da.Describe(), python list comprehension, arcpy.da.SearchCursor, and arcpy.da.InsertCursor(). In each section, a code block is provided but not ready to run. You need to add this notebook to ArcGIS Pro, modify each block to make it runable, keep the output message , and write an explanation of the code block. \n",
